    <h3><u>Short Back story!</u></h3>

      <p>
        As everybody else, I was always a big dreamer. however my dream was not limited to a particular field,
        infact it is not particularised now as well. I loved football very much. Likewise sketching was one of my big hobbies.
        But these hobbies did not work well.
      </p>

      <p>When I completed my school I wanted to join MBBS but that was not in my fortune.
        I dropped my study for a year and joined Engineering.
        I am an Electronics and Communication Engineer.
        It is after I joined Engineering that I grew my interest towards Internet,
        website building and other similar fields. After a year of my researches online,
        consulting my collagues, my teachers, my seniors and almost everyone around me I felt â€“
        Oh yes, now I know a little bit of it. Then I started my rough works playing with laptops and internet the whole day.
        Actually, I was interested towards it when I heard people making money online just lying in bed. My mind was blown away by that.
